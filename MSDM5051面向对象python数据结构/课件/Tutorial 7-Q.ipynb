    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming is just the fancy name of **\"divide-and-conquer with a table\"**. Instead of solving subproblems recursively, we can solve them sequentially and store their solutions in a table , so that whenever the solution to a subproblem is needed, it is already available in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefit** - You can use dynamic programming whenever a divide-and-conquer method yield an exponential number of subproblems, but only because a small number of subproblems repeated exponentially. It just makes more sense to compute each solution once and store it away in a table for later use, than recomputing it recursively everytime it is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tradeoff** - Storing the solution of each subproblem takes up computer memory. But it is still a great deal because we have transformed an exponential time problem into a problem that only costs polynomial time and space. Moreover memory is not really a big concern with nowadays' computers.\n"
