    "\n",
    "In last tutorial, I have demonstrated how to write DFS using recursion. In fact, as pairing with BFS using a queue, DFS can be realized using a stack. Try to rewrite DFS using stack instead of recursion. You may begin with the code of BFS. Assume all nodes in the graph are connected.\n",

    "- **Inductive step**: Mark the current vertex as \"visited\", then propagate to each of (i.e. `for` loop) the un-visited vertex and repeat."
