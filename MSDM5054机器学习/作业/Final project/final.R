# Random Forest:
#
# The idea of random forest: On the basis of bagging (changing training samples), the diversity of the base learner is further enhanced
# by changing the modeling variables. Specifically: for each node of the base decision tree, from the change of the node randomly 
# select a subset containing k variables from the quantity set, and then select an optimal variable from this subset for branching.
#
# For each tree i = 1, ・ ・ ・ ,T: (1) Use the Bootstrap method to extract n sample observations from all training sample observations to 
# form the Bootstrap data set D*; (2) Based on data set D* Construct a tree hi and repeat the following steps for each node in the tree
# until the stopping rule is met; (3) Output a combination of T trees.
#
# The computational complexity of random forest is: T(O(nk log2(n)) + O(s) + O(n))
# The computational complexity of the base decision tree is O(nk log2(n)); The complexity of Bootstrap sampling and voting/averaging 
# is O(s); variables are randomly selected at the root node and intermediate nodes, with about n nodes, Therefore the complexity is O(n);
# There are T base decision trees in total.

# Gradient Boosting Trees:
# 
# Decision Tree (GBDT) is an additive model form: fm(x) = fm-1(x) + hm(x).
# Consider the squared loss function, The hm(x) generated at step m should be in the direction of the local maximum decrease of L 
# with respect to fm-1(x). In summary, at the mth step: hm(x) should be in the local direction described by the gradient
# -gm = y - fm-1(x) up. hm(x) should be a decision tree with εm = y - fm-1(x) as the dependent variable.
#
# The computational complexity of the decision tree can be expressed as O(TNMlog(M)), where T is the number of iterations.

#2
# Decision trees have strong interpretability, while random forests are relatively weak in model interpretability.

# Decision tree is a machine learning algorithm based on tree structure. Each node of the decision tree represents a feature 
# attribute, the branches of the node represent the value of the feature attribute, and the leaf nodes represent the final 
# classification or regression results. Due to the clear structure, we can directly observe the judgment conditions and branch 
# paths of each node to understand how the model makes predictions.

# Random forest is an ensemble learning method that consists of multiple decision trees. The final prediction result of 
# a random forest is obtained by voting or averaged by all decision trees. Each decision tree may adopt different features 
# and parameter settings, so the interpretability of the entire model becomes more difficult. In addition, random forest 
# introduces randomness in the construction process, including random selection of features and random sampling of data, 
# which also increases the difficulty of fully interpreting the model. Since the number of decision trees in a random forest 
# is large and the contribution of each decision tree is relatively small, it is difficult to map the prediction results of 
# the entire random forest to a single feature or decision.

#3
# Construct a Lagrangian function: Lagrange = L(Y, f) + λ(f1 + f2 + ... + fK), minimize Lagrange.
# We take the partial derivatives of f1, f2, ..., fK and λ and set them equal to zero to get the following system of equations:
# 
# exp((-Y・f*)/K) ・ (-Y1/K) + λ = 0
# exp((-Y・f*)/K) ・ (-Y2/K) + λ = 0
# ...
# exp((-Y・f*)/K) ・ (-YK/K) + λ = 0
# f*1 + f*2 + ... + f*K = 0
# 
# We can use numerical optimization methods to approximate the solution, such as gradient descent.
# The class probability can be expressed as P(Y = 1 | G = Gk) = P(G = Gk). Yk = 1 or Yk = -1/(K-1). therefore:
# P(Y = 1 | G = Gk) = P(G = Gk) = (1 + 1/(K-1)) * P(Yk = 1)
# P(Y = -1/(K-1) | G = Gk) = (1/(K-1)) * P(Yk = -1/(K-1))
# By definition we have ∑P(Yk = 1) = 1, therefore ∑P(G = Gk) = 1.
#
# When we minimize the loss function L(Y, f), the value of the loss function increases for misclassified samples and decreases 
# for correctly classified samples. This causes the weight of incorrectly classified samples to increase and the weight of 
# correctly classified samples to decrease in the next iteration.
# Similar to Adaboost, we can calculate the weighting factor for each sample based on the classification error. Specifically, 
# for sample i, we define the weight factor as: wi = exp((-Yi・f)/K). This weight factor is consistent with the form of 
# the loss function L(Y, f)

#4
# Suppose there is an optimal classification hyperplane whose distance to the left is greater than the distance to the right.
# In this case, consider two projection points on the optimal classification hyperplane, which are located on the boundaries of the left and right intervals respectively. 
# Let the projection point on the left be A and the projection point on the right be B.
# Since the distance on the left side is the largest distance on the right side, we can move the projection point A on the optimal 
# classification hyperplane along the direction of the normal arrangement, and at the same time move the projection point B to the 
# right until they are both located on their respective boundaries, instead of changing Classification results of data points.
# Doing this will cause the method of optimizing the classification hyperplane to change, but since we only made small adjustments, 
# this new hyperplane will still be able to correctly classify the data points of both categories.
# However, this contradicts the definition of a maximum margin classifier.

#5
# Contains three types of support vectors:
# 1.Points lying on hyperplanes L+1 and L-1.  (0 < λi < C and ξi = 0 );
# 
# 2.Points that fall within the interval and are correctly classified.   (λi = C and 0 < ξi ≤ 1);
# 
# 3.Points that are not correctly classified.   (λi = C and ξi > 1).

#6
# From the perspective of loss function plus penalty: ξi can be expressed as: ξi = max(0,1-yi(β^T * xi + β0)). This is Hinge Loss.
# Using hinge loss, the above objective can be rewritten as: min(β,β0){1∑n(1-yi(xi^T *β + β0)) + λ/2|β|^2))}

#7
# The fundamental difference between the two algorithms is that K-means is essentially unsupervised learning, 
# while KNN is supervised learning; K-means is a clustering algorithm, and KNN is a classification (or regression) algorithm.
# 
# KNN belongs to supervised learning, and the categories are known. By training and learning the data of known categories, 
# we can find the characteristics of these different categories, and then classify the unclassified data.
# 
# Kmeans belongs to unsupervised learning. It is not known in advance how many categories the data will be divided into, 
# and the data is aggregated into several groups through cluster analysis. Clustering does not require training and learning from the data.

#8
# Principal components analysis is an unsupervised technique that projects raw data into several high vertical directions 
# These high vertical directions are orthogonal, so the correlation of the projected data is very low or almost close to 0. 
# These feature transformations are linear.

# An autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that compresses data into lower dimensions and then reconstructs 
# the input. Autoencoders find lower-dimensional representations of data by removing noise and redundancy on important features.

# PCA can only perform linear transformations, while autoencoders can perform both linear and nonlinear transformations;

# The PCA algorithm is fast to calculate, while the autoencoder needs to be trained through the gradient descent algorithm, 
# so it takes longer time;

# PCA projects the data into several orthogonal directions, while the data dimensions are not necessarily orthogonal 
# after autoencoder dimensionality reduction;

# The only hyperparameter of PCA is the number of orthogonal vectors, while the hyperparameters of the autoencoder are 
# the structural parameters of the neural network;

# Autoencoders can also be used on complex, large data sets.

#9
# Bias: As the number of layers of a neural network increases, the complexity of the model increases and it usually fits 
# the training data better, so the bias gradually decreases. Deeper networks can learn more complex features and patterns, 
# thereby increasing the flexibility and expressiveness of the model.

# Variance: When the number of layers of a neural network increases, the complexity of the model also increases, which may 
# lead to overfitting to the training data. Overfitting means that the model adapts too well to the details and noise of the 
# training data, resulting in reduced generalization ability on new unseen data. Therefore, the variance may increase.

#10

# Input: training set D ={(x_n,y_m, verification set V, learning rate α, regularization coefficient λ, number of network layers L, 
#        number of neurons M_l,1<=l<=L

# Repeat:
#       Randomly reorder the samples in the training set D;
#       for n = 1...N do:
#             Select samples (x_n,y_n) from the training set D;
#             Feedforward calculates the net input z_l and activation value a_l of each layer until the last layer;
#             Back propagation calculates the error δ_l of each layer;
#             Calculate the derivative of each layer parameter;
#             # Any l, dL(y_n,y^_n)/dW_l = δ_l・(a_(l-1))^T;
#             # Any l, dL(y_n,y^_n)/db_l = δ_l;
#             Update parameters;
#             # W_l ← W_l - α(δ_l・(a_(l-1))^T + λW_l);
#             # b_l ← b_l - α(δ_l);
#       end;
# Until the error rate of the neural network model on the validation set V no longer decreases.

# Output W,b
